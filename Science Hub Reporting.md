##Science Hub Reporting - H2

#### H2 Goals

Goal | On-Track/Blocked 
----- | -------- | 
Onboard 2nd class of fellows (joint onboarding with Open Web Fellows) | DONE
Launch Study Group onboarding | ON TRACK
Ship v1 of Open Data curriculum | AT RISK

#### Accomplishments (What progress did we make towards these goals?)
* [SEPT] Successfully completed a week of joint on-boarding of MLN Fellows (Open Web and Science).  There was only one afternoon where the two groups split apart to discuss program specific issues.
* [SEPT] Most of the content for the Study Group Orientation materials is complete.  Will have done by end of first week in October.
* [SEPT] The draft Open Leadership Training Series was reviewed in full by a group of x-MLN community members in July, revised/rewritten and augmented with media assets in August, tested by 1st leaders cohort in August-Sept, currently in process of putting Beta version on the Teachable platform.

#### Learnings (What challenges did we face/what went well/what did we learn?)
* [SEPT] The two Fellows programs have been operating on very different schedules.  We worked hard to bring them more in sync and managed to schedule the onboarding for the same week.  Based off feedback from the Fellows on the first day of onboarding, we learned there is a surprising amount of overlap in interests / needs of the two programs and were able to revamp the onboarding on the fly to take advantage of that.  Now the challenge is to figure out how to expand that to provide more opportunities for program collaboration throughout the Fellowship.
* [SEPT] Still settling into new group structure and identifying roles of team members as well as how to shift some activities to community members.  See below re: strategic planning and leveraging expertise of Fellows and expanding network.

#### Priorities for next month (What are we focusing on next?)
* [SEPT-OCT] Over the next couple months we'll work with the Advocacy team to fine tune the joint onboarding as well as look for more opportunities to bring the two programs more inline and collaborative throughout the Fellowships.
* [OCT] Strategic planning for 2017 - to incl development of a Communication Plan, discussion on funding needs for coming year, opportunities for cross-MLN synchronization (Fellows, Global Sprint, Website, Study Groups/Clubs)
* [OCT-NOV] Finish up Study Group materials.  Early October will make training materials publicly available and get feedback to iterate on materials.  Goal is to have materials in polished form in January for a structured and mentored orientation with Study Group Leads.
* [OCT-DEC] Do some planning around Study Group cohort model and marketing of new orientation materials and training.
* [OCT-NOV] Leverage the expertise in our new Fellows cohort to make progress on the Open Data Curriculum and test before end of year.
* [OCT-DEC] We are looking at ways to further expand the network with an eye toward opportunities for collaborations and partnerships that are of benefit to all of MLN.  This has already shown up in our Advisory Group nominations as well as who we are inviting as volunteers to the next All Hands.

#### Risks/Blockers (Are we at risk of not reaching our goals? List dependencies)
* [SEPT] We are not on track for meeting Goal 3 because of the need for focus on the Fellows program, OLTS, and Study Group Orientation for the last few months.  The lead on that project is figuring out how to move this work forward while managing several new responsibilities.
