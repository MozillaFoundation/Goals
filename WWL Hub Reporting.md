##Women & Web Literacy Hub Reporting - H2

#### H2 Goals

Goal | On-Track/Blocked 
----- | -------- | 
Release research papers and develop position paper on how Mozilla will contribute to the women and web literacy space | Final review before being released in soft-touch version. 
Launch hub and announce steering committee members  | We launched hub but opted not to do a steering committee in light of the new MLN advisory committee. 
Host steering committee kick-off and Women and the Web convening  | No committee kick-off because of above. Women and Web Convening being planned for October. 

#### Accomplishments (What progress did we make towards these goals?)

* SEPTEMBER: Lauched [equals](http://equals.org/) campaign as part of our partnership of The Global Partnership to Ensure Gender Equality in the Digital Age, a project being led by ITU and UN Women

#### Learnings (What challenges did we face/what went well/what did we learn?)
* [SEPT] Had a very quick and successful implementation of the WWL site. Debrief and what went well/challenges [here](https://github.com/mozilla/womenandweb/issues/47)
* [AUG] [SEPT] Challenge getting reports approved and published in the right mediums. 
* [AUG] Challenging to manage expectations of the many stakeholders in the room and various proposals for WWL program
* Mozilla is being a more known name in the conversation around gender issues and technology
* Work on Mozilla Clubs for Women and Girls is resulting in a larger movement and more clubs growing outside of pilot areas

#### Risks/Blockers (Are we at risk of not reaching our goals? List dependencies)

* [Blocker] Capacity. Need a network manager.
