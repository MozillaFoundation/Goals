#### Learnings (What challenges did we face/what went well/what did we learn?)
Q3:
* Goal of Hub: Digital Equity
* Conditions: Web Literacy and Privacy are well poised to be skills sets that advance Digital Equity with open innovation as the character of the ecosystem, member-driven practices, with decentralization of access and knowledge as value-add to networks
* City-based learning networks/structures see advocacy as essential next step in impact, growth and value of participation
* Hives are mature enough to unify practices, membership design, portfolio criteria, retention through cross-city collaborations/joint projects
* Grant-making is foundational for MoFo Network Health metrics


#### Priorities for next month (What are we focusing on next?)
Q4
* Unifying the offerings of the Hub
* For ex: Public Hub presence (web presence with coherent narrative, offerings, OER)
* Clarifying how clubs intersect/are housed
* Begin process for “manifesto” with key field ally


#### Risks/Blockers (Are we at risk of not reaching our goals? List dependencies)
* Capacity, capacity, capacity; Expectations exceed capacities
* Dotted lines re: areas of decision-making, ownership and impact
* Funding pipeline in limited
