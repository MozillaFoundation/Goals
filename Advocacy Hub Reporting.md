#### Learnings (What challenges did we face/what went well/what did we learn?)
* Collaborating really benefits our work 
* There's a gap when it comes to advocacy training and skills that we can help with 
* Working with the hubs is a great way to source new campaign areas.

* October - Women and Girls convening with advocacy

#### Risks/Blockers (Are we at risk of not reaching our goals? List dependencies)
